features:
- title: Elegant Web App with Vue.js
  details: The website is made with Vue.js 2, one of the most popular front-end frameworks.
- title: Solid Rest APIs with Node.js
  details: The APIs are made with Node.js and Express.js, they use cookies as a wrapper for JWT in order to provide both performance and security. Every request is validated by keeping security in mind. 
- title: Clear code with Typescript
  details: Both the Web App and the APIs are written in Typescript, so that bugs can be discovered during development.
- title: Fast database with MongoDB
  details: MongoDB is used as database to provide performance and flexibility.
- title: Easy translations with POEditor
  details: The frontend uses i18n and json files for the translations, that are mapped on POEditor so that anyone can update them.
- title: Even an SDK for the APIs
  details: The Web Ap uses an SDK, published to NPM, to make the calls to the APIs. This way additional services written in javascript would have an easy way to interface with the APIs.
